# DATA-VIZUALIZATION

![Screenshot from 2023-08-06 20-18-27](https://github.com/IanNIraj/DATA-VIZUALIZATION/assets/136542083/a7051ece-b846-42e6-99e0-627203e27478)

code creates an interactive data visualization dashboard using Dash and Plotly. It includes two charts: a scatter plot showing sepal length vs sepal width by iris species, and a bar chart showing the average petal length by species. You can interact with the charts by clicking on the bar chart to filter the scatter plot and vice versa.

The code provided is an example of a data visualization dashboard built using the Dash framework, which is a Python web application framework for building interactive, web-based data visualizations. The dashboard uses the "Iris" dataset as a demonstration.

# Real-World Significance and Usage:

You could replace the "Iris" dataset with your own dataset related to various business metrics, such as sales, revenue, customer demographics, etc.

The dashboard could help business stakeholders visualize and explore data trends, correlations, and insights. For instance, they could analyze how different product attributes impact sales performance.

The scatter plot and bar chart illustrate how interactive dashboards allow users to explore data by clicking on charts, filtering, and updating other charts in real-time.
